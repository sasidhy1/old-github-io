	<h2>Comic Influences:</h2>
	<section>
		<p>In his youth, Hergé admired Benjamin Rabier and suggested that a number of images within <em>Tintin in the Land of the Soviets</em> reflected this influence, particularly the pictures of animals. René Vincent, the Art Deco designer, also affected early Tintin adventures: "His influence can be detected at the beginning of <em>the Soviets</em>, where my drawings are designed along a decorative line, like an 'S'." Hergé also felt no compunction in admitting that he had stolen the image of round noses from George McManus, feeling they were "so much fun that I used them, without scruples!"</p>
		<p>During the extensive research Hergé carried out for <em>The Blue Lotus</em>, he became influenced by Chinese and Japanese illustrative styles and woodcuts. This is especially noticeable in the seascapes, which are reminiscent of works by Hokusai and Hiroshige.</p>
		<p>Hergé also declared Mark Twain an influence, although this admiration may have led him astray when depicting Incas as having no knowledge of an upcoming solar eclipse in <em>Prisoners of the Sun</em>, an error T. F. Mills attributed to an attempt to portray "Incas in awe of a latter-day 'Connecticut Yankee'".</p>
