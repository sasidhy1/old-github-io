	<h2>Professor Calculus:</h2>
	<section>
		<p><strong>Professor Cuthbert Calculus</strong> (<em>Professeur Tryphon Tournesol</em> in Herg√©'s original version; <em>tournesol</em> is the French word for sunflower) is an absent-minded and partially-deaf physicist and a regular character alongside Tintin, Snowy, and Captain Haddock. He was introduced in <em>Red Rackham's Treasure</em>, and based partially on Auguste Piccard, a Swiss physicist. The leading characters do not initially welcome his presence, but through his generous nature and his scientific ability, he develops a lasting bond with them. Eventually, by the end of <em>Land of Black Gold</em>, he becomes a resident of Marlinspike Hall.</p>
		<p>Normally mild-mannered and dignified, Calculus occasionally loses his temper and acts in a spectacularly aggressive manner in response to actual or perceived insults, such as when Captain Haddock belittles his work or accuses him of "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBGyPZkpWz8">acting the goat</a>". He is a fervent believer in dowsing, and carries a pendulum for that purpose. Calculus's deafness is a frequent source of humour, as he repeats back what he thinks he has heard, usually in the most unlikely words possible. He does not admit to being near-deaf and insists he is only "a little hard of hearing in one ear."</p>
